Question 1: How is the communication between the host and the graphic card handled?

Through buffers and command queues.

Question 2: What function executes your kernel?
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel

Question 3: How does the kernel know what element to work on?

Through:
size_t get_global_id(uint dimindx);

QUESTION 4: How much data did you put in local (shared memory?

old ans: 64 * KERNELS * 2  pixels (x3 for RGB)

QUESTION 5: How much data does each thread copy to local memory?

old ans: 2 pixels

QUESTION 6: How did you handle the necessary overlap between the work groups?



old ans: 
index depend on the local id i.e. 
get_local_id(0) = x 
get_local_id(1) = y

QUESTION 7: If we would like to increase the block size, about how big work groups would be safe to use in this case? Why?



QUESTION 8: How much speedup did you get over the naive version?
