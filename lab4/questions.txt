How many cores will simple.cu use, max, as written? How many SMs?
16, 1 block == 1 SM

Is the calculated square root the same on CPU/GPU, should we assume this is always the case?
The same and no this is not always the case since GPUs utilize fused multiply-add operator and the CPU does not.
The CPU might also have a different precision than the GPU, even if results are rounded to the same precision the result may vary.
