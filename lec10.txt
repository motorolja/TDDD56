__global__
  entry point

__device__
  internal functions for the GPU

compiler: nvcc
          - .cu files
          - may compile only CUDA specific parts and let gcc/g++ compile .c/.cpp
          - nvcc cuda_code.cu -o cuda_kernel.o -c
          - g++ main.c

To run, make sure the proper library is in the environment variables.

Every thread does its own calculation for indexing memory
